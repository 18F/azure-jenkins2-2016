# azure-jenkins2-2016

Temporary home for deploying Jenkins 2 into Azure: reliably, repeatably, compliantly


## Local Setup
There are a couple different setup instructions in README files:
- [CHEF-AZURE-POC](CHEF-AZURE-POC.markdown) launches a generic server in Azure with Chef.
- [JENKINS-AZURE-WITH-TESTS](JENKINS-AZURE-WITH-TESTS.markdown) runs `tla_jenkins`. Both locally on docker, with tests; and in Azure.
